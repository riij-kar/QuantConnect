  Types of Continuation Patterns:
  Triangles:
    Three potential triangle variations—ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles.
      Ascending:
        Understanding the Ascending Triangle Pattern
        An ascending triangle is a breakout pattern that forms when the price breaches the upper horizontal trendline with rising volume. It is a bullish formation.
        The upper trendline must be horizontal, indicating nearly identical highs, which form a resistance level. The lower trendline is rising diagonally, indicating higher lows as buyers patiently step up their bids.
        Buyers eventually lose patience and rush into the security above the resistance price, which triggers more buying as the uptrend resumes. The upper trendline, which was formerly a resistance level, now becomes support.
      Descending:
        Analyzing the Descending Triangle Formation
        A descending triangle is an inverted version of the ascending triangle and is considered a breakdown pattern. The lower trendline should be horizontal, connecting near identical lows. The upper trendline declines diagonally toward the apex.
        The breakdown occurs when the price collapses through the lower horizontal trendline support as a downtrend resumes. The lower trendline, which was support, now becomes resistance.
