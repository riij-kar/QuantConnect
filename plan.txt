Based on **everything you need**, your screenshots, your workflow (LEAN JSON → Python → UI), and the kind of visualizations you want (stacked multi-pane, multiple indicators, volume, equity curve, drawdown, toggles, settings), here is the **most accurate recommendation**:

---

# 🟩 **Use TradingView Lightweight Charts ONLY for the MAIN price chart**

(Candles + Volume + EMAs + VWAP + Signals + Trendlines)

# 🟥 **Use Apache ECharts for all secondary panels**

(RSI, ATR, Equity Curve, Drawdown, Performance Boxes, Multi-panels)

This hybrid setup is the **best** because:

---

# 🟩 Why Lightweight Charts for the main price chart?

Because nothing comes close to this:

### ✔ Ultra-smooth zoom/pan (better than Plotly/ECharts)

### ✔ Candles render like TradingView

### ✔ Perfect for high-resolution market data

### ✔ Easy markers (buy/sell arrows)

### ✔ Great for multi-timeframe overlay

### ✔ Works offline, free, MIT license

### ✔ Institutional-level performance

### ✔ You want that TradingView-style price chart — THIS is it

The main chart (candles + EMAs + VWAP + volume overlay + signals) **must** feel responsive and smooth. Lightweight Charts excels here.

---

# 🟥 Why ECharts for all other indicator panels?

Because Lightweight Charts is **not designed for complex subplots**, but ECharts:

### ✔ Handles unlimited panels stacked vertically

### ✔ Handles independent axes, zoom sync, custom visuals

### ✔ Supports RSI/ATR/MACD beautifully

### ✔ Perfect for equity curve, drawdown curve, histograms

### ✔ Tons of visual customization

### ✔ Can render huge data nicely

### ✔ Easy Python → JSON → chart mapping

### ✔ Better layout flexibility than Plotly

Your second screenshot (big multi-panel view) is **much easier with ECharts** than Lightweight Charts.

---

# 🟩 Why *not* use Lightweight Charts for everything?

Because:

* No native multiple y-axis panes
* No built-in grid layout support
* No separate indicator pane spacing
* Harder to create equity/drawdown panels
* Hard to style non-price charts
* No candlestick-like shapes for drawdown / p&l
* Minimalistic API (meant ONLY for price charts)

It's best used exactly how TradingView itself uses it:
👉 as the **main chart engine**.

All your lower panels (RSI/ATR/Equity/Drawdown) are **non-price indicators**, and ECharts is perfect for those.

---

# 🟥 Why *not* use only ECharts for price chart?

Because:

* Candlestick zoom/pan less smooth
* Interaction not as fluid
* Not “TradingView feel”
* Not optimized for large candle datasets (1m data for 3 years)
* Markers / overlays are more manual

Your price chart experience **will not feel premium**.

---

# 🟩 Why *not* use only Lightweight Charts for everything?

Because:

* No multi-panel layout
* You will struggle to reproduce your entire multi-indicator layout
* RSI/ATR/Equity Curve/Drawdown become too hard

Lightweight Charts = great for price
ECharts = great for analytics

---

# 🟩 You want BOTH: trading chart + analytics stack

Based on your screenshots:

### Your setup =

* Main chart
* Volume panel
* RSI panel
* ATR panel
* Equity curve panel
* Return % panel
* Drawdown panel
* (many more in future: OBV, MACD, RS, Supertrend, etc.)

**Only a hybrid LWC + ECharts system keeps everything fast and beautiful.**

# 🧱 Architecture I recommend (final)

## **1. Dash / Flask / PyQt front-end**

| Component                                   | Library                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Main price chart                            | **TradingView Lightweight Charts** |
| Volume on main chart                        | Lightweight Charts                 |
| Buy/sell markers                            | Lightweight Charts                 |
| EMAs / VWAP                                 | Lightweight Charts                 |
| Secondary indicators (RSI, ATR, MACD, etc.) | **Apache ECharts**                 |
| Equity curve                                | ECharts                            |
| Return %                                    | ECharts                            |
| Drawdown curve                              | ECharts                            |
| Portfolio TurnOver/Exposure.Strategy capacity | ECharts                            |                        |

## **2. Python backend**

* Load LEAN JSON
* Compute indicators with pandas / ta-lib
* Export arrays for JS:

  * `{time:..., open:..., high:..., low:..., close:...}`
  * `{time:..., value:...}`
  * Separate JSON per panel

## **3. Chart Sync**

* Sync time range between panels
* When you pan price chart → move all indicator charts
* ECharts supports “dataZoom sync”
* Lightweight Charts supports “visible range” events

---

# 🧨 Final Recommendation Summary (super clear)

### 🔥 **Use Lightweight Charts for PRICE-CHART ONLY**

Smoothest, highest-quality, exact TradingView feeling.

### 🔥 **Use ECharts for indicator panels (RSI/ATR/Equity/Drawdown)**

Flexible, customizable, perfect for dashboards.

### 🧠 No single library gives both TradingView smoothness + complex analytics.

The hybrid approach is exactly what professional trading dashboards do.
